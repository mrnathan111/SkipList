# SkipList
Goals: Working with dynamic arrays, pointers, doubly linked lists

When searching a Skip List, items can be found in O(log n) time. No duplicates are allowed. A SkipList can have multiple levels. SkipList of depth 1 is similar to a doubly linked list. All elements are inserted into a single doubly linked list.

When a SkipList has multiple levels, all elements are inserted at level = 0. 50% of those inserted at level = 0, are also inserted at level = 1. 50% of those inserted at level = 1 are also inserted at level = 2, and so on.
